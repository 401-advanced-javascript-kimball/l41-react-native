# LAB - React Native - Milestone 1: MVP

Create your first native phone/device application using React Native, tapping into at least 2 phone features.

## Before you begin
Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

## Getting Started

**Confirm the following**

* Install XCode (Mac Users)
* Install Android Studio (All Users)
    * Install 1 device emulator
* Install expo-cli
* Create an account at expo.io
* Create a login for snack.expo.io
* Create google play and apple developer accounts

## Assignment
Create your first Phone App. What it does and how it looks is up to you. 

### Application Requirements
* Use 2 screens
* Use and share state between components/screens
* Use at least 1 native device feature (contacts, camera, gps, etc)
* Properly Documented for End Users
* Live Demo

### Milestone 1 - MVP (This Lab)
* Deliver your MVP for raw functionality
* Your dev environment should be properly working
* Other users should be able to scan your QR and see your app on any device
* All of your core "features" should be working properly
  * Unstyled is fine. We're looking for things to buzz, light up, detect movement, etc.


###  Documentation
For this assignment, instead of writing developer documentation, write end user documentation.

"How do I use this application"

We recommend using the "Steve Jobs" standards, which is to say that your app should be so easy to use and should do such an obvious thing that documentation isn't required.

That said ... it's required. Shoot for the Jobs standard, but document this like you're going to sell it on the *App Store* (you might)
